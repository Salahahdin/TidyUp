Make cleaning easier.
That's what my fiancee said to me. Our Google Calendar was full of other events so adding each about cleaning. There is no sense to keep so many tasks, better to create something tailored for our needs. So I decided to create TidyUp. Simple app, very similar to todo apps. But this one is focused only on cleaning. And also it's perfect way to learn more about Java :)

Current tech stack:
-JavaFX
-Maven
-Me, the developer

The app language is currently polish. More to come.
